# Description

This project is designed to be a great starting point for new backend projects using Express with Typescript, with basic linter config.

# Prerequisites

This is a node-express backend project. Before installing, download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) or _preferrably_ [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) and use the latest LTS version available.

Use [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) or [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) to manage packages. Since yarn >= 2.x creates some problems for Typescript module resolving, old version is preferred by far.

# Installation

- `yarn install`

- `yarn run husky install`

- `yarn start`
